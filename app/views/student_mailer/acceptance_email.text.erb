Dear Rails Girls Summer of Code applicant,

we are both very much thrilled and equally humbled about how Rails Girls Summer
of Code over the last few weeks has grown into a huge program that is very
likely to make a real difference.

This community just rocks!

We are proud to say that we have received 80 applications from over 140
students from all over the world. Amongst them some are outstandingly well
prepared, some come with an amazing support network from coaches and local
communities, some include outright moving personal stories.

We have reviewed all of these applications and they have been rated by a
committee of 9 members. This was quite some work, but we are very happy to say
that we have finalized this process yesterday. So we can now announce our first
group of participants.

Congratulations for being accepted into Rails Girls Summer of Code go out to
the following teams!

  1. Carla (Australia) and Anja (Germany) to work on: Sinatra and Farm Subsidy
     Open Government Data
  2. Cecilia (Argentinia) and Mayn (Norway) to work on: Open Source Job Board
  3. Jen and Joyce (both USA) to work on: Bundler
  4. Laura and Adriana (both Colombia) to work on: Rails (Conductor)
  5. Magdalena (Poland) to work on: impress.js
  6. Maja and Nina (both Slovenia) to work on: Spree
  7. Nicole (Germany) and Laura (USA) to work on: RailsApps and Rubinius
  8. Saskhi and Pallavi (both India) to work on: Diaspora
  9. Wiktoria and Alicja (both Poland) to work on: Species+

(ordered alphabetically, not by ranking)

If you or your team is not on this list - don’t worry. That does not mean your
summer can’t be a Summer of Code! Here is what you can do:


1) Join the program as a volunteering student / team

If you want to work on your project without monetary support, then please tell
uns. We will automatically accept you into the program and you’ll get all the
benefits like access to remote support chat rooms, supervision, visibility to
the community etc.


2) Cross your fingers

We are trying to raise more money for the campain and hope that we will be able
to offer some extra last-minute slots. If we have sufficient budget, we will do
another selection round next week.

Please tell us if there’s a deadline on which you’d need to be notified at the
latest so you can still start working on your project on July 1st (some of you
might need extra time to prepare).

Also, if you were planning to work on a project that was also chosen by a team
from the ones listed above, please update your application.


3) Get involved with your local communities

If you don’t want to stick to a strict coding program, but want to continue
getting more into code, we can help you form project groups for coding, find
user groups, organize Hackdays, Summer Camps etc. Just get in touch and we will
connect you and support you with all our collective wisdom :)


Thank you so much for your wonderful applications!

Sincerely yours,
the Rails Girls Summer of Code team
